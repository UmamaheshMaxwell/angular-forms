Template Driven Forms
---------------------
1. There are simple forms which can be used to devlop webforms. 
2. These are called template driven as everything that we are going to use in the application 
   is defined in the template.

3. The form is setup using #ngForm Directive 
4. Controls are set up using ngModel directive
5. ngModel provides two-way data binding


Advantages
------------
1. Contains little code in the component class
2. Easier to setup

Disadvantages
------------
1. Difficult add controls dynamically
2. Unit testing is a challenge

Reactive Forms
----------------
Reactive forms are the forms where we define the structure of the form 
in the component class.

We create reactive form model with Form Groups, Form Contols amd Form Arrays

How to use Reactive Forms Module
--------------------------------
1. Import ReactiveFormsModule
2. Create Fomr Model in component class using "Form Group"
3. create the hTML from resembling the form Model
4. Bind the HTML from to form model

Form Group
------------
Form group takes 3 arguments, a collection of child form control,
a validator and an asynchronous validator

* Validators, synchronous and Asynchronous validators are optional
